# Intro

*creedenzymatic* is a pipeline R package to combine, standardize and visualize kinomic analyses from different tools (KRSA, UKA, KEA3, PTM-SEA)


```{r setup}
library(creedenzymatic)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Input

The different kinomic tools (KRSA, UKA, KEA3, PTM-SEA) produce different outputs with various scoring metrics. To standardize the input in this package, we want to extract only two variables from each tool: **Kinase** and **Score.**

**Kinase**: will be the main identifier used in each tool. For example, in KRSA this variable will be indicating kinase family, but with UKA it will be individual kinases.

**Score**: The main metric used in the corresponding tool. For example, in KRSA this will be a Z score, in UKA it will be either kinase statistic or kinase score.

# A vs B

```{r ce_1}

# reading files and ranking kinases for each tool
combined_df <- creedenzymatic(KRSA_table = "input_data/KRSA Table", 
                              UKA_table = "input_data/UKA Table",
                              LFC_table = "input_data/LFC Table",
                              avg_krsa = T, avg_lfc = T, prefix = "Comp1"
                              )

# extract top kinases
extract_top_kinases(combined_df, min_qrt = 4, min_counts = 2) -> sig_kinases


combined_df %>% filter(hgnc_symbol %in% sig_kinases) %>% 
  quartile_figure()


```
